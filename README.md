# Edmonton Bike Parking Project

This is a fork of Civic Tech TO's awesome [BikeSpace](https://gitlab.com/bikespace/Bicycle-parking) project. A huge thanks to everyone on the team!

This PoC was done in March 2019 to see if it could be valuable to Edmontonians. The work contained in this repo has now been added to BikeSpace proper, so submit all issues [here](https://gitlab.com/bikespace/Bicycle-parking).

This repo exists just for posterity.
